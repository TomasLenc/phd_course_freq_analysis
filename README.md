Collection of MATLAB scripts for the classes on freqency-domain analysis (PhD electrophysiology course at the BCBL). 

To run  some of the code, you will need to have the `rnb_tools` package on your MATLAB path. Download it [here](https://github.com/TomasLenc/rnb_toos). 

To learn how to practically do time-frequency analysis (and more), I really recommend Mike Cohen's book Analyzing Neural Time Series Data: Theory and Practice. [Here is the accompanying code](https://github.com/mikexcohen/AnalyzingNeuralTimeSeries) to play with.
